Instruction to run code
-- Input files and recordings are present in Input folder
-- here there are two input file....one is abhik (recorded by me) other 
   is sir_recording (recording provided by sir) inside the Input folder
-- Just change the fin.open (.....) parameter according to your pc location 
   and simply run


Logic
1. Stored ZCRs and Energies of the wave in samples of 320.
2. Then found out the word boundaries using energy calculated in step 1. 
3. After finding out word boundary, iterate over each word and analyse the
   ZCR of second half of each waveform. If it is greater than a threshold
   then it is 'YES' else 'NO'.
